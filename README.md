Repository featuring JACK'N POY - the Filipino Version of Rock-Paper-Scissor Game, made by yours trully.


## My Message to You!
Hello everyone!
This repository is intended for the Rock-Paper-Scissor Game of The Odin Project (TOP). Although this project is part of TOP curriculum, it is good to mention that all of the codings and algorithms that I have used here are purely coming from my *blood, sweat, tears* and extracted **brain juice** (LOL!). I am creating a good practice of not copying other dev's code as I want to develop my problem-solving skills (and also I love the satisfaction that it gives me whenever my codes work.) With all these things that I have mentioned, my codes can be a little bit messy so please bear with me. But don't worry, as I progress through the Odin's and other courses, I'll make sure I'll apply all my learnings to keep my codes simple and readable.

Thanks for visiting my repo!


## Updates

### July 27, 2023
Hello again! I have finished making the *console-only* version of Jak N' Poy. The game is now pretty playable, but ofcourse with the use of console only (LOL!). The syntax that I have used here are just basics -- things that I currently learned about JavaScript. And yes, although I mentioned that I used the BASICS, I still spend a couple of days (or I think a week? lol) just to make this work. Nevertheless, I pretty much ENJOYED every obstacles that I have encountered and every progress that I made! It made me realized that coding is really challenging, yet very fun!

PS: I tried to include my algorithms as comments in this file.
